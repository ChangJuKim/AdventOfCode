# AdventOfCode
My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

I will log my journey here.

Day 1 Calorie Counting:
  Simple problem. Decided to parse and solve in a main method. 
  Asked ChatGPT for feedback on improving my code:
    Helped me use scanner class to parse my input, and implemented its feedback of using try-with-resources instead of a try block for my scanner class.
    Learned a lot about scanner.

Day 2 Rock Paper Scissors: 
  Added common folder to hold a ParseInput file with common parsing functions. 
  Updated file structure for better naming conventions
  Asked ChatGPT for feedback:
    Added constants to the top of my file such as the INPUT_PATH
    Added exception throwing if there is invalid input instead of printing out an error
    Learned about and implemented JavaDoc comments

Day 3 Rucksack Reorganization:
  Asked ChatGPT for feedback:
    Improved variable naming

Day 4 Camp Cleanup:
  Asked for feedback:
    Improved function names
    Added a constant for a regex
    For part 2, added constants for error messages to put them in one place
    Simplified logic in code

...

Day 10 Cathode-Ray Tube:
  Discovering limitations of ChatGPT -- did not ask for feedback on improving code.
  Continuing to add JavaDoc comments, constants, and input validation

Day 11 Monkey in the Middle:
  Learning about builder design. Using it to create Monkeys.
