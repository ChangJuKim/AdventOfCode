# AdventOfCode
My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) problems.

I will log my journey here.

Things I have learned and practiced throughout my journey:
  * Using scanner class for parsing input
  * File structure and file/folder naming
  * Code improvements
     * Adding constants and global variables
     * Exception throwing instead of printing errors
     * JavaDoc comments
        * Later learned that these are not necessary for private functions and code that is not client-facing
     * Variable naming
  * Builder design pattern
  
  * Reducing comments to only when they are necessary
  * Simplifying functions and classes to numerous smaller, more readable ones
     * Keeping in mind the Single Responsibility Principle


## [Day 14 Regolith Reservoir](https://github.com/ChangJuKim/AdventOfCode/tree/main/advent_of_code_2022/problem_14):
  * Read Robert C. Martin and Prentice Hall's Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship and decided to start implementing what I have learned
  * In particular
     * Reducing comments
     * Keeping classes and functions small
     * Considering how to make my code more readable
     * Understanding that my task isn't done once the code works. It is done after you are finished editing it.
  * After I go through all 25 days, I will go back to my previous problems and improve them
